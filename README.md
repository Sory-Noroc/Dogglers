Dogglers
==================================

Code for the second independent project for [Android Basics in Kotlin](https://developer.android.com/courses/android-basics-kotlin/course).

Introduction
------------
Dogglers is an Android App with an interactive way of showing cute dogs in different layouts, like vertical, horizontal and grid. The images are already part of the project, so there is no need to import them.
